# 🎯 Complete Setup Guide - Qurtuba Fashion

This guide will help you set up the complete database integration for your Qurtuba Fashion application.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup (Required)

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `dbjaogpesmyrqjwtzzwr`

2. **Run the Complete Database Schema**
   - Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy the entire contents of `complete-database-schema.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL editor
   - Click **Run** to execute the schema

3. **Verify Tables Created**
   - Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
   - You should see these tables:
     - ✅ users
     - ✅ roles  
     - ✅ customers
     - ✅ orders
     - ✅ invoices
     - ✅ invoice_items
     - ✅ customer_measurements
     - ✅ pages
     - ✅ actions

### 2. Test the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the Application**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001/
   - Check browser console for database test results

3. **Verify Database Integration**
   - Look for these messages in console:
     - ✅ "Supabase connection successful"
     - ✅ "Database initialization completed successfully!"
     - ✅ "All database tests passed!"

## 🗄️ Database Features

### Complete Table Structure

| Table | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **users** | User management | Roles, permissions, authentication |
| **roles** | Permission system | Page access, action permissions |
| **customers** | Customer data | Measurements, order history |
| **orders** | Order management | Status tracking, customer linking |
| **invoices** | Invoice system | Auto-numbering, payment tracking |
| **invoice_items** | Invoice line items | Detailed item breakdown |
| **customer_measurements** | Body measurements | Height, shoulder, waist, chest |
| **pages** | System pages | Dashboard, customers, orders, etc. |
| **actions** | System actions | Create, read, update, delete, etc. |

### Automatic Features

- **Auto Invoice Numbering**: Invoices get unique numbers (INV0001, INV0002, etc.)
- **Customer Total Tracking**: Automatically updates customer spending
- **Data Synchronization**: Keeps local and cloud data in sync
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet using local data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when Supabase is unavailable

### Local Database (Electron)

- The desktop app uses a local SQLite database (better-sqlite3) stored under the OS user data directory.
- Data includes customers, invoices (with `fabric_image_url` stored as TEXT), orders, roles, and an outbox for sync.

#### Local DB Self-Test

Run a built-in self-test to verify local DB read/write and image URL persistence:

1. Launch the Electron app:
   - Windows: run `run-desktop-app.bat`
   - Or: `npm run electron:dev`
2. From the app menu or tray, click "اختبار القاعدة المحلية".
3. A dialog will show a report. Success confirms that:
   - A test customer, invoice (with `fabric_image_url`), and order were created
   - Records were read back correctly
   - Customer update persisted
   - Outbox entries were recorded for sync

Notes: Self-test records are labeled "SelfTest" and filtered from normal UI lists by name.
